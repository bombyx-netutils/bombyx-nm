What's the difference:
1. all the wifi connection is pre-configured.
2. normal network:
     dhcp -> dns -> dns-sd -> failed -> mdns
3. ad-hoc network
     auto-generate-ip -> mdns -> mdns-sd
     (show special information)
4. provide it's own dns resolver, so that we can do dns 
5. tethering
6. wake-on-line and wake-on-wlan
7. use plugin to implement advanced function.
   1. vpn
   2. cgfw
   3. web cache
   4. ids
   5. auto penetration
   6. try and record public APs
8. compatible mode



Roadmap:
1. eth and wifi
2. applet
3. wake-on-line
4. sgw-api
